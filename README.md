# Hello, I'm Joshua D'Crus

This is the code of the website that I began building on the 16th of January, 2026. I originally began making a website in late 2023 or early 2024, but forgot about it (and the files ended up getting misplaced anyway), so I am redoing it.

This website holds (or should hold, since I have barely started at the time of writing this) a brief introduction about who I am, along with my skills, different experience I have, random projects I've made, and my resume.

Thank you for checking it out! :]
